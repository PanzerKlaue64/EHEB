<h1> Connected Souls and others </h1>
<a href="EH .html">Home page</a>
<p> Connected souls are the mixture of an <i>earth heart</i> and it's soul. When the two are met and combined they create what we call a "Connected Soul". Other products of different souls i.e. inbreds. (our term of people that connect with hearts that are not their own). They tend to twist and mutate into a different amalgamation of what they once were becoming a blob of flesh and what was once humans. These <i>inbreds</i> are believed to be in extreme pain during and after contact with a heart.</p>
