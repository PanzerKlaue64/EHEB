<h2>What is an earth heart?</h2>
<p>An <i> earth heart </i> is a plant based heart for the people around the world. The exact number of these <i>earth hearts</i> is currently unknown, but in our posession we currently have 352,000 in our care at the Gaia Facility. Out of these 352,000 we have connected 5 of them to their <a href="CS .html">connected souls.</a> </p>

<h3>What do you do if you find an earth heart?</h3>
<p> <i> Earth Hearts</i>	 are quite rare in the wild despite their vast abundance. On the rare ocassion that you do find one it is crucial you do not touch one as they are very fragile and can lead to the alarming of what we call heart guardians. These creatures are very hostile and can eurupt from the ground or descened from a tree. They are known to have a very high fatality rate and will not stop until the heart does not detect you or the creature is terminated.</p>

<h3>Functions of an Earth Heart.	</h3>
<p> We here at the EHEB have found many different uses to an <i>earth heart</i>  with some being, increased life span, super human strength and dexterity, and the ability to find other <i>earth hearts</i>. Why do they have these amazing qualities? With the research we conducted, we still do not know why they have these properties however we can say that these extrordinary pieces of nature. These hearts are protected however by a plethora of different entities we call Heart Guardians we have currently found 15 different variations of these guardians. </p>

<h2> Who are we? </h2>
<p>  We are the EHEB located at the Gaia facility in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. This facility is supervised by our first-class science team studying and supervising the <i> earth hearts </i>. While our excavation team continues to search for more <i> earth hearts</i>  to take under our care and control. The CSE is our security force making sure nobody harms these delicate parts of the earth and humanity as the consuquenses cannot be forseen. </p>
